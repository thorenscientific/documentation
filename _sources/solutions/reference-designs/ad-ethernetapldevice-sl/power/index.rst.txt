Circuit Analysis
----------------

The main goal for the power circuit of the reference design is to
make sure that even if the power produced from the source port is as
minimal as 540mW, or if the power received of the load port (field
device or the :adi:`AD-ETHERNETAPLDEVICE-SL` itself) is as minimal as
only 500mW for Power Class A, the board should still operate normally
on those circumstances. Which means the reference design board should
consume low power as possible that it doesn't violate the boundaries
of line current and voltage range indicated in the specifications.

This is why the :adi:`LT8440` Power conditioner is important and acts
as main anchor part of the design, because it pulls at minimum 20mA
to drive the protection diodes of the APL line to conduct power and
provide data communication, and also enters shunt regulation mode to
pull enough power for the device to function, while also limiting the
current and power at 650mW maximum worst case to prevent overheating
to comply with intrinsic safety. Ideally its best to select power
parts of the best efficiency so it will only pull much lesser current
on the LINE_P and LOAD_P during normal operation. However, if cost
and small form-factor is the primary concern (in this case on this
reference design with DIN-B form factor), we can slightly compromise
the efficiency but making sure first that it won't violate the line
current ceiling it can pull to the :adi:`LT8440`.

LT8440 Operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The LT8440 can operate on two different constant current regulation:
Shunt Regulation Mode and Current Limit Mode, depending on the
voltage sensed by the LINEA and LINEB pins of LT8440, and the current
that will flow to the LOAD_P thru the system of
AD-EthernetAPLDevice-SL, it will dictate the regulation amplitude of
the line current and which mode it will regulate. For the complete
specification of LT8440 for Table 4, Table 5 and Table 6, see the
Electrical Characteristics on LT8440 datasheet.

The line current will also depend on both the shunt current
(I_SHUNT) and LOAD_P current (I_LOADP) as the line current (I_LINEP)
is the summation of I_LOADP and I_SHUNT shown in Equation 1.

.. math::

   I_LINEP = I_LOADP+I_SHUNT (1)

.. csv-table:: Line Voltage Threshold for sensed voltage between LINEA and
   LINEB (Excerpt only - incomplete table)
   :file: Line_thresholds.csv

During Shunt Regulation Mode, the shunt pin of the LT8440 is
conducting in which it satisfies Equation 1.

The shunt pin will conduct if the current I_LOADP is not conducting
(0mA) or I_LOADP is only minimal or lesser than the typical Shunt
Regulation Mode current indicated in table 5 so the shunt pin detects
the lack of I_LOADP, then the shunt pin pulls more current so that
I_LINEP will regulate the current within the boundaries indicated on
Table 5.

Shunt current will only be equal to the line current if LOAD_P is
operating at No-Load (0mA). If there is a minimal I_LOADP current,
the Shunt current self-adjust to be what is indicated on Equation 2,
which is simply a linear algebra manipulation of Equation 1.

.. math::

   I_SHUNT = I_LINEP - I_LOADP   (2)

For example: for LINE_P voltage of 10.5V, and I_LOADP = 10mA, the
Shunt pin will pull the current I_SHUNT = 30mA approximately, so that
it will satisfy the I_LINEP = 40.5mA (for Level 1) or I_LINEP =
39.7mA (for Level 2).

.. csv-table:: Regulating Line Current during Shunt Regulation Mode (Excerpt
   only - incomplete table)
   :file: Regulation.csv

The LINEA and LINEB pins sensed the voltage on the input line and
dictate the current regulation, the position in which the LINEA/B
connected will have a different measured or sensed voltage while
still complies to the specifications indicated on Table 3 and Table
4, which is provided completely on the LT8440 datasheet.

The LINEA/B should be connected after the polarity protection diodes
indicated in Figure 3, so that the effective capacitances and
inductances that will generate discharges of the system is being
isolated by the diodes, and it will not be counted to the effective
capacitance nad inductance of the input line or the load port, this
is based on Table 1 of  IEC60079-47, the allowable internal line
capacitance is only 5nF, and allowable line inductance is 10uH. This
will however result for the sensed voltage to be lower at normal
operation because of the forward voltages of diodes reducing the
sensed voltage.

At lower sensed voltage, the current regulation of the LT8440 will
have a higher offset current, but it is still in line with the
electrical specification of LT8440, and the power limiter will still
work as intended.

Figure 3 is the designed configuration for AD-EthernetAPLDevice-SL
to pass the Intrinsic safety design certification.

Power Tree Design
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Initial step is to design the power parts after the LT8440 with the
theoretical assumption of the power at maximum load condition that
guarantees to operate the critical signal chain parts of
AD-EthernetAPLDevice-SL, which are going to pull power from the
LT8440's LOAD_P node. The performance of the design for current and
power on LOAD_P shall not exceed the specifications or shall not trip
the limits of LT8440 itself and the APL Specifications.

Tabulating the estimated power budget of AD-EthernetAPLDevice-SL at
maximum load based on the datasheets of the significant parts of the
signal chain, we can calculate the theoretical power consumption at
worst case and select appropriate power parts for the power tree
using the LTPOWERPLANNER for the Power Tree calculation.

.. csv-table:: Power Budget at Estimated Full Load
   :file: Power_estimation.csv

In the power tree provided in Figure 8 based on estimated power
budget at full load.

The reference design incorporates a for the different needed rails,
mainly the triple output of 3.3V (3V3), 1.8V (1V8) and 1.1V (1V1)
lines to power-up the common parts, a separate 3.3V line (SUP_3V3)
dedicated to supplying power for the supervisory circuit, and an
isolated 3.3V (ISO_3V3) for supplying the data isolator and A/D
Converter temperature sensor interface.

   :alt: AD-EthernetAPLDevice-SL Power Tree

   AD-EthernetAPLDevice-SL Power Tree

The LT8606 acts as the pre-regulator of the power tree, it has a
wide range of input voltage, capable of up to 42V maximum operation,
small, efficient, and requires low component, this is suitable to the
wide voltage range of 9V to 15V (or 17.5V maximum) on the LINE_P that
will translate to a slightly reduced wide voltage on the LOAD_P node,
take note that the voltage rating of the selected buck converter is
considered with the 2/3 derating. The 350mA max current can provide
more leeway (from 2/3 de-rating) and still is suitable for this 500mW
system. The UVLO prevents the converter from operating if the LOAD_P
voltage from the ethernet cable is too low, thus preventing some
faulty operating conditions.  Zener diodes are added to clamp the
output rail and guarantee it will not exceed the VZ = 4.7V under any
conditions, important as overvoltage protection for intrinsic safety,
because it relaxes the requirements for picking parts when the
voltage and power are much lower after the LT8440 and the Zener
diodes.

For simulation using LTSPICE for example (or estimation via
datasheet), the LT8606 buck has an estimated efficiency of 90.3% and
in the LTPOWERPLANNER power tree, the calculated maximum pulled
current is 42.8mA in the input of LT8606, which is also the LOAD_P
node. Among the parts for the main voltages 3V3, 1V8 and 1V1, the
1V8 is the one that needs the most current as most of the signal
chain parts, which are ADIN1110 and MAX32690, needed the supply
voltage of 1.8V. To sustain a better efficiency so it won't pull too
much current from the output of LT8606, we need another buck
converter. The selected part for 1V8 output is MAX17626, it is
small, high efficiency capable and requires low component count so
it's easy to implement. By simulation using for example the EE-SIM
Oasis software (or estimation via datasheet), the estimated
efficiency given by the input and output voltages is 83.2% in which
is indicated in the power tree of LTPOWERPLANNER.

The 3V3 and 1V1 pulls very low current, so LDO regulators are better
and cheaper with negligible effect on power loss. In this case we
picked the ADP151 series of LDOs with fixed values for 1.1V and 3.3V
because of small form factor, reduced cost and lower component
count.

The MAX253 push-pull converter is the selected isolated power part
because of minimal design requirement or low component count. Based
on the datasheet using 1:1.3 transformer, the estimated efficiency is
84%. This is negligible for estimated drawn current of 4.5mA at the
output with calculated output voltage of 4V to 4.3V. The push-pull
won't regulate properly at light load or lower current, so a post
regulator LDO is included to provide the fixed 3.3V isolated voltage
for the A/D converter and digital isolator. The AVDD of ADFS7124-4
can be sensitive or in risk of noise, so an optional RLC low pass
filter is included. Zener Diodes are also included in the MAX253
output to prevent overvoltage by clamping it to VZ = 4.7V during
potential overvoltage fault and for general intrinsic safety.

For functional safety specifically on the supply for the supervisory
circuit like the MAX42500, the voltage line that is supplying should
not be the voltage it monitors. A separate 3.3V line is powering the
supervisor using ADP151-3.3V LDO which is labeled SUP_3V3, therefore
the MAX42500 will still work properly even if there is an OV/UV
event occurring to 3V3, 1V1, and 1V8.

For the external SPI of AD-EthernetAPLDevice-SL, we included a
dedicated supply pin of external 3.3V, although it is not counted in
the overall power calculation because the SPI's load specification
is not defined. However, the extra power that is available or unused
will be dedicated to the external SPI, with the main LDO selected is
ADP123. The LDO's dedicated VOUT feedback is usable for application
were we need to modify the output voltage it will regulate. This is
specific for intrinsic safety case where a limiting resistor is
added, but the output should still maintain in 3.3V.

Based on the calculation of the LTPOWERPLANNER, the maximum power or
full load is approximately 300mW which is the estimated power pulled
on the LOAD_P, and the I_LOADP only pulls an estimated maximum
current of 42.85mA, which didn't exceed the limit of 55.56mA of APL.

Note: The actual power on the board can be much lesser than the
calculated power because the parts like the MAX32690 and ADIN1110
won't require to fully utilized that much power to function. The
actual or measured power and current are discussed on the Power
Consumption section.

Power Consumption
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Characterizing the performance of the LT8440 Power Conditioner and
the entire Power Tree, the following curves are captured at ambient
temperature of 25 degrees Celsius (typical).

.. figure:: LOAD_P.png
   :alt: LOAD_P (Load Side) and Shunt Parameters

   LOAD_P (Load Side) and Shunt Parameters

The load side power and current are pulling approximately 288mW and
21.38mA respectively at 15V line voltage, these are the highest
parameters that the load side or LOAD_P node will consume during
normal operation.

For 9V line, the load side power and current are pulling
approximately 260.9mW and 19.706mA respectively at normal operation.

The reference design is operating on LT8440's shunt regulation mode,
where the shunt pin is pulling current. The shunt power and current
are pulling approximately 122.03mW and 9.03mA respectively at 15V
line voltage, while its approximately 19.71mW and 2.79mA
respectively at 9V line voltage. The highest shunt power occurred
at 12.7V line voltage which is approximately 139.46mW.

The shunt and load side power are small enough to not violate the APL
limit when adding the two parameters.

.. figure:: Efficiency.png
   :alt: Efficiency and Current of Power Tree

   Efficiency and Current of Power Tree

The power tree was designed with the intention of prioritizing the
small form factor and cost of parts, so there is a trade-off in the
power efficiency for these power parts that are connected after the
load side of LT8440.

As shown in Figure 6, the efficiency in range of 33.04% up to
36.65% which is not high and is a significant trade-off despite the
very low power consumption, as long as it does not exceed the APL
Limit power consumption of 500mW. Which on another point of focus,
the efficiency can be trade-off, but the power pulled, or to be more
specific, the current being pulled should be low enough that it
would not exceed the current ceiling of the APL limit as shown also
in Figure 6. So, when sacrificing the efficiency, it will pull more
current and power, but those two parameters must not exceed what is
indicated on the APL requirements like the 55.56mA maximum current at
9V, and the 500mW limit for the entire line voltage range.

   :alt: LINE_P Power Performance at Normal Operation, Shorted and
         Opened Load

   LINE_P Power Performance at Normal Operation, Shorted and
   Opened Load

Speaking of the line voltage range of APL, the actual entire power
consumption range of the whole reference design is measured, the
power curves are shown in Figure 7. During normal operation, which
is for the boundaries of APL profile specs in the line voltage range
of 9V to 15V, the maximum power occurred at LINE_P for line voltage
of 12.7V is 484mW, which if compared to the open or disconnected
load side of LT8440 at shunt mode, the power is the same 484mW at
12.8V line voltage instead.

For Intrinsic safety scenario at line voltage range of 9V to 17.5V as
dictated by IEC60079-47 standard, the maximum APL line power is
625.62mW during the scenario that the load side is intentional
faulted/shorted, it did not exceed the maximum die power rating of
650mW, and is within below the 5.32W specification of IEC60079-47,
therefore the LT8440 is doing its function as a power conditioner at
normal operation and as a power limiter during fault scenario.

   Opened Load

The triangular nature of the power curve of LINE_P is a result of the
staircase like nature of the I_LINEP or APL line current. This is
from the inherent design or construction of the LT8440 silicon in
which it has hysteresis in its sensing of voltage during current
regulation, so the shifting of current regulated has hysteresis
transition first whenever the sensed voltage changes or varies.

For the line currents, none of it exceeds to the limits of APL
during normal operation, and also shorted operation of IEC60079-47
as shown in Figure 8.
