   ADALM-MMSC Board

The :adi:`Analog Devices Active Learning Module-Mixed-Mode Signal Chain (ADALM-MMSC) <ADALM-MMSC>`
is an educational board designed to facilitate hands-on exploration of
fundamental signal chain concepts.

The core of the circuit is the :adi:`AD4080`, a 40 MSPS oversampling 
SAR analog-to-digital converter (ADC) with a configurable digital filter 
and internal data capture memory (single-port FIFO).

The board includes a highly configurable 2nd order analog filter with
adjustable cutoff frequencies, input attenuation, and filter gain.

An onboard selectable clock source provides sample rates from 5 MSPS to
40 MSPS. A :adi:`MAX32666FTHR` microcontroller runs an IIO server 
over a serial backend, allowing the use of standard tools such as Scopy, 
IIO Oscilloscope, Pyadi-iio, and ADI's MATLAB precision toolbox.

The Libiio library provides language bindings for C, C#, MATLAB, Python,
and other languages.

Concepts demonstrated include:

- Digital filtering
- Analog vs. digital anti-alias filtering
- Properties of different digital filters
- Noise analysis
- Reference noise

   - Input and output test connections for monitoring all critical points
- Onboard low-noise reference
   - Flagship LTC6655 for optimal performance
   - "Reference Corruption" input allows noise and interfering tones to be
     introduced and their effects observed
- Selectable conversion rates from 5 MSPS to 40 MSPS allow observation
  of aliasing and ADC noise density vs. sample rate

Quick Start
-----------

There are numerous combinations of signal sources, signal analyzers, and
software that can be used with the ADALM-MMSC. The most straightforward
approach to get up and running and establish baseline functionality is to use
the :adi:`ADALM2000` with Scopy. Scopy is a general-purpose IIO-based utility
with instrument-specific control panels for various hardware, including
the :adi:`ADALM2000`.


**Equipment Needed**

- 1x ADALM-MMSC Board (as Device Under Test)
- Windows, Mac, or Linux host computer with an available USB port
- Signal generator such as the :ref:`ADALM2000<m2k>` or similar
  Alternative signal sources include:

   - Generators in the audio range work well
   - A PC sound card with Audacity is another option

Hardware Setup
--------------

The hardware setup uses the :adi:`ADALM2000` (M2K) as the primary signal source
for the system, as shown in the image below. In this configuration, the M2K's
waveform generator outputs are connected to the designated input pins on the
ADALM-MMSC board, allowing the board to receive and process test signals. 

.. figure:: adalm-mmsc_hardware_setup.png

   ADALM2000 (M2K) to ADALM-MMSC Hardware Setup
   
1. Connect the two black GND wires from the ADALM2000 to the 
   lower two posts of P17 (Pins 3 and 4).
2. Connect the solid yellow W1 wire from the ADALM2000 to P17 Pin 1.
3. Connect the striped yellow W2 wire from the ADALM2000 to P17 Pin 2.
4. Connect both the ADALM2000 and the ADALM‑MMSC to the host computer 
   using two micro‑USB cables.

Software Setup
--------------

**Requirement:**

.. admonition:: Download

   :download:`Scopy (latest version) <https://analogdevicesinc.github.io/scopy/index.html>`


1. Connect the **ADALM‑MMSC** to the host computer using a
   **USB‑A to USB‑Micro** cable, then open the **Scopy** GUI.

2. If you are using the :adi:`ADALM2000`, connect the instrument and allow
   the calibration process to complete.

3. From the Scopy home screen, add the ADALM‑MMSC connection by clicking
   the ``+`` button, as shown in the figure below.

4. Click the ``Scan`` button and select the ADALM‑MMSC serial port.
   More than one serial port may be listed, depending on the devices
   connected to the host machine.

7. Once connected, Scopy is ready to acquire data from the ADALM-MMSC.

   a. Open the **ADC Time** panel.
   b. Set the buffer size to **4096** (maximum is **16384**, limited by the
      AD4080 FIFO depth).
   c. Click ``Start``.

8. The figure below shows the ADC output when the signal generator is
   configured as follows:

   - Channel 1: **1 Vpp**, **500 kHz** sine wave
   - Channel 2: **1 Vpp**, **50 kHz** sawtooth

   :git-no-OS:`ADALM‑MMSC firmware (no‑OS) <projects/adalm-mmsc>`.

2. Download the pre‑built firmware binaries from the no‑OS releases page:

   `ADALM‑MMSC releases <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/no-OS/releases/tag/last_commit>`_

   The firmware package is provided as ``adalm-mmsc.zip``.

3. Use the included **MAX32625PICO** board to upgrade the firmware.

4. Follow the instructions in the MAX32625PICO firmware images repository
   to load the MAX32666FTHR‑specific binary:

   `MAX32625PICO firmware images
   <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/max32625pico-firmware-images>`_

5. Connect the 10‑pin ribbon cable between the **MAX32625PICO** and the
   **MAX32666FTHR** board.

6. Drag and drop the file
   ``adalm-mmsc_maxim_iio_example_max32665.hex`` into the
   **DAPLINK** drive (typically ``D:\`` or ``E:\`` on Windows).

7. Wait for the DAPLINK drive to automatically eject, indicating that the
   firmware upgrade has completed successfully.
