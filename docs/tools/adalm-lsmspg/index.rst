   ADALM-LSMSPG

The :adi:`ADALM-LSMSPG (Analog Devices Active Learning Module - Low-Speed Mixed-Signal Playground) <ADALM-LSMSPG>` 
facilitates hands-on learning of concepts related to software interfacing to hardware peripherals.

It consists of two 8-channel multifunction ADC/DAC/digital GPIOs -  :adi:`AD5592r` and :adi:`AD5593r`-
which have SPI and I2C interfaces, respectively.

The :adi:`AD5592r` includes a simple NPN transistor curve tracer circuit as a representative instrumentation
application.

The :adi:`AD5593r` includes a PNP curve tracer, and both devices include bi-color LEDs for "Hello, World!"
applications.

An :adi:`LM75` temperature sensor is also included as a "bare minimum" peripheral example.

The :adi:`ADALM-LSMSPG` is compatible with Raspberry Pi and Feather form factor hosts, and an
:adi:`ADALM2000` interface allows monitoring of the SPI and I2C busses for driver development and debug.

Curve Tracer Application Circuits
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The :adi:`AD5592r` and :adi:`AD5593r` drive simple NPN and PNP (respectively) curve tracer circuits. 
This represents a simple DC test instrument that involves the "set a current, set a voltage,
take a measurement, do some math, step, repeat" sequence of operations. 
The details of the experiments are covered in the
`Tools for LSMSPG Lesson <https://analogdevicesinc.github.io/documentation/learning/tools_for_ls/index.html>`__.

The PNP curve tracer has two options for the emitter drive: AD5593r CH3 (default), or the 3.3V
supply rail.

Hardware Setup
++++++++++++++

- **Raspberry Pi Setup**:

For Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, 4, and 5, use the included ribbon cable to make the connection as shown
in the figure below. 

.. figure:: rpi-4_5_w_with_lsmspg.png

   RPi Zero 2W/4/5 and ADALM-LSMSPG with 40-pin Ribbon Cable Connection 


For Raspberry Pi 400 and 500, use the included ribbon cable to make the connection as shown in
the figure below. 

.. figure:: rpi-400or500_with_lsmspg.png

- **Feather Setup**:

Most Feather platform boards ship without peripheral headers installed. Refer to the board's
instructions, and install either:

 - Downward-facing 100-mil post headers
 - Stacking headers with posts extending from the reverse side of the board.
 - Install the Feather on P20 as shown in the Figure below.

Software Setup
++++++++++++++

Raspberry Pi Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Prepare an SD card with ADI Kuiper Linux following the instructions at
:ref:`ADI Kuiper Linux Guide <kuiper>`.

Add the following to the end of ``/boot/config.txt``:

.. code-block:: none

   # config.txt additions

   dtoverlay=rpi-adalm-lsmspg

   # Heartbeat blinky:
   dtparam=act_led_gpio=20
   dtparam=act_led_trigger=heartbeat

   # Short GPIO21 (pin 40) to ground for shutdown:
   dtoverlay=gpio-shutdown,gpio_pin=21,active_low=1,gpiopull=up


With the ADALM-LSMSPG connected, the heartbeat LED will begin beating on boot.
The shutdown button is a convenient means of shutting down the Raspberry Pi
properly in headless situations (no local monitor or keyboard). Press the
shutdown button, wait 5 seconds after the heartbeat LED stops blinking, and
then it is safe to remove power.

MAX32666FTHR Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :adi:`MAX32666FTHR` includes a :adi:`MAX32625PICO` debugger that can be used to load 
the ADALM-LSMSPG firmware image. Prepare the MAX32625PICO itself with the MAX32666FTHR-specific
DAPLink image from: :git-max32625pico-firmware-images:`MAX32625PICO firmware images <+>`

Leave the MAX32625PICO plugged in, and plug in the MAX32666FTHR using another
USB-Micro cable. Connect the debug interface to the MAX32666FTHR with the supplied
10-pin ribbon cable. Download the ADALM-LSMSPG tinyiiod firmware image
(filename ``adalm-lsmspg.zip``) from:
:git-no-os:`ADALM-LSMSPG firmware (no-OS releases) <releases/tag/last_commit+>`

Unzip the archive, copy the ``adalm-lsmspg_maxim_iio.hex`` file, and paste it into
the DAPLINK mass storage device (typically ``D:`` or ``E:`` on Windows systems).
The DAPLINK drive will auto-eject, and the heartbeat LED on the ADALM-LSMSPG
will begin blinking.

Application Setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Detailed instructions for various application software examples are included in the
`Tools for LSMSPG Lesson <https://analogdevicesinc.github.io/documentation/learning/tools_for_ls/index.html>`__,
as well as other supporting material. The underlying API for Raspberry Pi/Linux and
bare-metal tinyiiod servers is ``libiio``, which can be installed from: 
:ref:`libiio documentation <libiio>`

Once installed, information about the ADALM-LSMSPG context can be displayed by
running ``iio_info`` and passing the URI argument.

For Kuiper Linux, the default hostname is ``analog``. Example:

.. code-block:: none

   iio_info - network

   iio_info -s ip:analog.local

For the MAX32666FTHR running the tinyiiod firmware, run:

.. code-block:: none

   iio_info - serial

   iio_info -s serial:COM4

Replace ``COM4`` with the appropriate COM port number on Windows, or ``/dev/ttyX`` on Linux.

The *Tools for Low-Speed Mixed-Signal System Design* tutorial contains many additional examples
of communicating with the ADALM-MMSC.
