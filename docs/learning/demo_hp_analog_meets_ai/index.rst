Demo description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This demo illustrates an AI-based multi-channel RF modulation scheme recognition
workflow for signal intelligence applications. Four AD-JUPITER-EBZ systems are
used to generate RF signals with different modulation schemes across a total of
eight channels. The signals are then digitized by two ADRV9009-ZU11EG SoMs,
which stream the raw IQ data to a host PC via 10Gb Ethernet links. The AI model,
derived from a MathWorks reference design, is deployed on the NVIDIA GPU hosted
in the PC. The NVIDIA Holoscan AI infrastructure manages the efficient transfer
of data from the network interfaces into GPU memory, where the AI model is
executed. By combining ADI’s high-performance data extraction infrastructure
with MathWorks development tools and NVIDIA deployment frameworks, the system
enables efficient AI application development and real-time execution for
advanced signal intelligence tasks.
