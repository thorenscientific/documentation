Signal Processing Concepts with ADALM-MMSC
===============================================================================

.. note::

   This is a work in progress. Raya is working on this docu!

Overview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This document provides a practical introduction to signal‑processing concepts
using the **AD4080 oversampled ADC**, the **ADALM2000 (M2K)**, and the **MMSC
platform**. It combines theoretical explanations with interactive Python scripts
to demonstrate frequency‑domain analysis, oversampling, digital filtering, and
noise behavior in a real mixed‑signal measurement setup.

The focus is on FFT‑based analysis, sinc filter behavior, and integrated noise
effects, allowing users to validate theoretical expectations through direct
measurement. All scripts referenced in this tutorial are available in the
associated repository.

User Guides
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using the Detect Sample Frequency Script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To run the **sampling frequency detection (Fs Detect) script**, begin by
powering up both the **ADALM2000** and the **MMSC board** equipped with the
**MAX32666FTHR microcontroller**.

Connect the **W1** output from the ADALM2000 to the **negative input (IN–)** on
connector **P17** of the MMSC board. Ensure that all ground connections are
correctly made. Configure the appropriate COM port on the host computer
to establish communication.

Next, run the Fs Detect script using Python. Open **Scopy**, navigate to the
*Signal Generator*, and configure a sine-wave output. The default input
frequency is typically **100 kHz**, but this value may be adjusted as needed.
Start the signal generator to apply the sine-wave input to the ADC.

**Scopy Sample Setup**

In the script’s graphical interface, enter the input frequency into the provided
text box. Data acquisition is controlled using the following buttons:

- **Run** → Begins continuous accumulation of ADC samples
- **Stop** → Halts acquisition
- **Single Shot** → Captures one buffer of data and stops

The script identifies the FFT bin containing the dominant spectral peak and
calculates the ADC sampling frequency from its location. The calculated value is
compared to the expected sampling frequency reported by the hardware, and the
error percentage is displayed.

**Expected Output**

Adjusting the physical clock on the AD4080 board causes the ADC sampling
frequency to change. This shift is reflected in the FFT output and calculated
sampling frequency in real time.

Using the Frequency Sweep Script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To run the **frequency sweep script**, begin by connecting the **ADALM2000** and
the **AD4080 evaluation board** to your computer. Ensure that the correct USB
interfaces and serial communication ports are specified in the script arguments.
The front‑end sampling frequency must match the rotary switch setting on the
AD4080 board—this is typically **40 MHz**.

Once the hardware is powered and connected, run the script using Python. The
graphical interface will launch automatically, providing user‑configurable input
fields for sweep parameters including:

- **Start frequency**
- **Stop frequency**
- **Step size**
- **OSR (Oversampling Ratio)**

Additionally, the interface offers radio buttons to select the desired **digital
filter type**.

Pressing the **Run sweep** button initiates the automated frequency sweep.
During operation, the interface displays:

1. **Time‑domain waveform**
2. **Frequency‑domain spectrum**
3. **Filter frequency response**

**Expected Output**

Using the AD4080 Sink Script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To run the **AD4080 sink script**, begin by connecting the **ADALM2000** and the
**AD4080 evaluation board**. Ensure the correct USB and serial communication
ports are selected.

Once the script is launched, configure:

- **Fundamental frequency**
- **Signal amplitude (dBFS)**

**Tab to change parameters**

   :width: 450

After configuration, the ADALM2000 generates a waveform containing a fundamental
tone, harmonics, and noise. The AD4080 captures ADC samples, which are converted
to voltage units, normalized to full scale, and analyzed using FFTs.

**Expected Outputs**

Using the Interactive Sinc Folding Script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To run the **Interactive Sinc Folding** script, connect the ADALM2000 and AD4080
evaluation board. Select the appropriate serial port and LibIIO URI.

The interface allows real‑time adjustment of:

- **Decimation ratio (OSR)**
- **Digital filter type**
- **Noise bandwidth**
- **Noise spectral density**

The frequency‑domain display updates in real time, showing how noise folds into
the baseband and how digital filtering shapes the spectrum.

---

Using the Noise Sweep Script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To run the **noise bandwidth sweep script**, connect the ADALM2000 and AD4080 and
verify the front-end sampling frequency.

Select the digital filter and OSR, then press **Start sweep**. The script
increments noise bandwidth from DC, captures ADC samples, removes DC offset, and
computes RMS noise using the standard deviation.

Measured results are overlaid with analytical reference curves derived from ideal
sinc‑filter responses.

Developer Overview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FFT Fundamentals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)** converts time‑domain samples into a
frequency‑domain representation, revealing sinusoidal components, harmonics,
and noise.

The frequency resolution is:

:math:`\Delta f = \frac{f_s}{N}`

The frequency represented by bin :math:`k` is:

:math:`f_k = \frac{k}{N} \cdot f_s`

If the input frequency is known, the sampling frequency can be estimated as:

:math:`f_s = \frac{f_{in} \cdot N}{k}`

---

Sinc Folding Concepts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Oversampling ADCs use sinc‑based digital decimation filters with repeating lobes
and nulls. As the output rate is reduced, energy outside the baseband folds back
according to the sinc filter response, producing predictable spectral shaping.

Higher‑order sinc filters provide stronger attenuation but introduce more
pronounced shaping. Increasing OSR reduces bandwidth and increases noise
suppression while moving folding points closer together.

---

Integrated Noise in Oversampled ADCs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Wideband noise is spectrally shaped by sinc filters before integration.
The observed RMS noise depends on the magnitude‑squared filter response and the
effective noise bandwidth.

Examining integrated noise behavior reveals how oversampling, filter selection,
and decimation affect noise performance.

Developer Guide
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The scripts implement FFT‑based spectral analysis, frequency sweeping, and noise
integration using consistent assumptions about sampling frequency, decimation,
and normalization.

- DC offsets are removed before noise calculation
- RMS noise is computed using standard deviation
- Analytical reference curves assume ideal rectangular noise shaped by sinc
  filter responses

This approach allows direct comparison between theoretical expectations and
measured ADC behavior.
