Tools for Precision Wideband Mixed Signal System Design
===============================================================================


| **Note:** This is a work in progress.

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

| The goal of this tutorial is to equip the reader with a collection of
  hardware and software tools for developing precision wideband
  mixed-signal applications.
| \*\* Content Guide:\*\* This tutorial includes complete written
  instructions, a video guide, and a slide deck that can be used for
  delivering as a hands-on workshop.
| What exactly does "Precision Wideband" mean? In the context of this
  tutorial, the "wideband" part means that **unlike** "low speed"
  applications, timing, or jitter, of individual samples with respect to
  previous and future samples **IS** critical. The application involves
  extracting information from arrays of samples that are correlated with
  each other in some way. AC performance metrics such as signal to noise
  ratio and total harmonic distortion extracted from a Fourier transform
  of the data **will** be considered. Even if the end applicaiton does
  not involve sinewaves, these metrics are almost always a useful
  indicator of performance.
| The "precision" part means that DC parameters such as offset, gain
  error, linearity, and temperature drift are also important.

| 
| **In contrast** - sample jitter is important in a "wideband"
  application. If you are measuring signal to noise ratio, the Signal to
  Noise ratio (SNR) can be no greater than:
| <m>SNR <= -20 \* log(2*pi*f\_{IN}*t\_{j})</m>
| where:
| <m>f\_{IN}</m> is the analog input frequency in Hz
| <m>t\_{j}</m> is the RMS jitter in seconds RMS
| In this tutorial, we will be generating excitation waveforms,
  digitizing time-domain signals, performing Fast Fourier Transforms
  (FFTs), extracting features from the frequency domain, and calculating
  measurement parameters. We **will** be measuring AC Signal to Noise
  Ratio (SNR), Total Harmonic Distortion (THD), measuring steps,
  wiggles, and other situations where precise timing is required.
| Throughout the exercises we'll be writing simple Python code to
  capture and analyze data, using the industry standard Industrial I/O
  (IIO) framework to interact with the ADC, and the popular NumPy and
  Matplotlib Python libraries. Thus this exercise also serves as a
  mini-tutorial on Python.
| ==== Materials ====

-  Raspberry Pi 4; 2G, 4G, or 8G version, OR Raspberry Pi 400 (the
   keyboard one).
-  5V USB-C wall adapter for Raspberry Pi
-  Colorimeter Setup. This is not in production (yet), but full gerbers
   are provided. The pull request is in review,
   `HERE <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/education_tools/pull/48>`__
-  Optical absorbance demonstration material such as:

   -  Optical filters such as `Roscolux Selector
      Pack <https://www.mcmaster.com/7769T9/>`__
   -  `API pH test and adjust
      kit <https://www.apifishcare.com/product/ph-test-adjuster-kit>`__

-  16GB (or larger) Class 10 (or faster) micro-SD card, with `Analog
   Devices Kuiper
   Linux </resources/tools-software/linux-software/kuiper-linux>`__
   installed
-  User interface setup (choose one):

   -  HDMI monitor, keyboard, mouse plugged directly into Raspberry Pi
   -  Host Windows/Linux/Mac computer on same network as Raspberry Pi

-  :adi:`ADALM2000<adalm2000>`
-  Clone or download zip of the Python code for this tutorial from:
   `Python Code for the Hardware and Software Tools for Precision
   Wideband Instrumentation
   Workshop <https://github.com/cristina-suteu/ftc23-hstpwi/>`__

| 
| This probably isn't necessary as of Kuiper 2022r2, but just in case
  you want to update pyadi-iio or have the examples in your home
  directory, run these commands in a terminal:

::

   git clone https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/pyadi-iio.git
   cd pyadi-iio
   sudo pip install .
