EVAL-AD9213-DUAL
===============================================================================

Dual 12-bit, 10 GSPS RF ADC platform with 20 GSPS interleaving via MCS.

Overview
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The :adi:`EVAL-AD9213-DUAL-EBZ` platform features two
:adi:`AD9213` single-channel, 12-bit, 10 GSPS radio frequency (RF)
analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) with a JESD204B interface. The
two converters are interleaved to achieve 20 GSPS, using their
built-in multi-chip synchronization (MCS) capability.

The :adi:`ADF4377 <en/products/adf4377.html#product-overview>`, a
high-performance, ultra-low jitter, dual-output integer-N phase-locked
loop (PLL) with integrated VCO, drives the interleaving. The
:adi:`LTC6955 <en/products/ltc6955.html>` low jitter fanout clock
buffer and the :adi:`LTC6952 <en/products/ltc6952.html>` JESD204B
clock generation and distribution IC together form a clocking
architecture optimized for multi-channel scalability.

The platform supports direct sampling of L, S, and C bands with up
to 8 GHz of instantaneous bandwidth (IBW) per channel. It delivers a
complete signal chain reference design — covering RF input networks,
clocking architectures, power distribution, and a full software stack
(HDL to MATLAB) - designed to accelerate prototyping and reduce
time to market.

Features:

- 20 GSPS sample rate through interleaving supporting up to 8 GHz of
  instantaneous BW
- Multi-chip synchronization (MCS) at 10 GSPS using a scalable reference
  distribution architecture
- Input network supporting a wide analog frequency range DC - 9 GHz
- Compact layout scheme that can be quickly adopted into a customer
  application

Applications:

- Electronic Warfare (EW)
- Electronic Countermeasures (ECM) / Electronic Counter-Countermeasures (ECCM)
- Radar
- Instrumentation
- Multi-channel Wideband Receivers
