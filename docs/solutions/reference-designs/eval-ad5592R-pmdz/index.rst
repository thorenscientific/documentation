Test Points
~~~~~~~~~~~

Users can also check the SPI signal quality, supply, and reference
voltage of the board using test points labeled SS, MOSI, MISO, VLOGIC,
and VREF

.. figure:: 5592-1.png

   Test Points Location

**Voltage reference configuration**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The default connection of the :adi:`AD5592R` **VREF** pin is shorted at pin 1
of JP1 solder jumper where you can easily configure your voltage
reference input at pin 1 of terminal block P2, either from an external
source or internal 2.5 V.

LED Indicator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The DS1 is the power green LED indicator of the board.

Power Supply Considerations and Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When using the :adi:`AD5592R` Pmod board, the 3.3 V power for the Pmod comes
directly from the host board it is connected to. The power from the host
is generally capable of providing up to 100 mA at 3.3 V, but for complete
Pmod power specifications, please click
:adi:`here <media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/ad5592r.pdf>`.

Device Driver Support
---------------------

There are two device driver solutions that are provided for controlling
the :adi:`EVAL-AD5592R-PMDZ:<EVAL-AD5592R-PMDZ>`

#. **AD5592R no-OS Driver**

   - The 
     :dokuwiki:`AD5592R no-OS driver <resources/tools-software/uc-drivers/ad5592r>`
     is used in bare-metal applications, typically running on low-power,
     embedded microcontrollers.

#. **AD5592R Linux Driver**

   - The 
     :dokuwiki:`AD5592R Linux driver <resources/tools-software/linux-drivers/iio-dac/ad5592r>`
     is used in applications running the Linux operating system,
     typically on larger processors and SoC devices.

   - The AD5592R Linux driver uses the Industrial Input/Output (IIO)
     framework, greatly simplifying the development of application code
     via the cross-platform Libiio library, which is written in C and
     includes bindings for Python, MATLAB, C#, and other languages.
     Application code can run directly on the platform board,
     communicating with the device over the local backend, or from a
     remote host over the network or USB backends.

System Setup Using ADICUP3029
-----------------------------

The :adi:`EVAL-AD5592R-PMDZ` can be used with
:dokuwiki:`ADICUP3029 <resources/eval/user-guides/eval-adicup3029>`.

Demo Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following is the list of items needed in order to replicate this
demo.

- **Hardware**

  - :adi:`EVAL-ADICUP3029 <EVAL-ADICUP3029>`

  - :adi:`EVAL-AD5592R-PMDZ <EVAL-AD5592R-PMDZ>`

  - Micro-USB to USB Cable

  - PC or Laptop with USB Port

- **Software**

  - PuTTY or other similar software

  - :git-eval-adicup3029:`ADuCM3029_demo_AD5592R.hex <releases/download/Latest/ADuCM3029_demo_ad5592r_ad5593r.hex+>`

.. important:: 

   There are two basic ways to program the ADICUP3029 with the 
   software for the AD5592R.

   #. Dragging and Dropping the Hex to the DAPLink drive

      - Using the drag and drop method, the software is going to be a
        version that Analog Devices creates for testing and evaluation
        purposes. This is the **EASIEST** way to get started with the
        reference design.

   #. Building, Compiling, and Debugging using CCES

      - Importing the project into 
        :adi:`CrossCore Embedded Studio <design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/software/adswt-cces.html>`
        is going to allow you to change parameters and customize the
        software to your application, but will a bit more advanced and
        will require you to download the CrossCore toolchain.

      Complete Raspberry Pi Setup

Application Software (All Platforms)
------------------------------------

Hardware Connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Libiio is a library used for interfacing with IIO devices and is
required to be installed on your computer.

.. admonition:: Download 
   
   Download and Install the latest 
   :git-libiio:`Libiio package <releases+>` 
   on your machine.

To be able to connect your device, the software must be able to create a
context. The context creation in the software depends on the backend
used to connect to the device as well as the platform where the
EVAL-AD5592R-PMDZ is attached. Two platforms are currently supported for
the AD5592R: Raspberry Pi using the ADI Kuiper Linux and the ADICUP3029
running the no-OS AD5592R demo project. The user needs to supply a
**URI** which will be used in the context creation.

The :ref:`libiio iio_info` command is a part of the libIIO package that reports
all IIO attributes.

Upon installation, simply enter the command on the terminal command line
to access it.

For RPI Direct Local Access:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block::

   iio_info

For Windows machine connected to Raspberry Pi:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block::

   iio_info -u ip:<ip address of your ip>

Example:

 - If your Raspberry Pi has the IP address 192.168.1.7, you have to use
   *iio_info -u ip::192.168.1.7* as your URI

 .. note::
   
    Do note that the Windows machine and the RPI board should be connected
    to the same network in order for the machine to detect the device.


IIO Commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are different commands that can be used to manage and control the
device being used. The :ref:`libiio iio_attr` command reads and writes IIO
attributes.

.. code-block::

   analog@analog:~$ iio_attr [OPTION]...

Example:

 - To look at the context attributes, enter this code on the terminal:

  .. code-block::
   
     analog@analog:~$ iio_attr -a -C

The :ref:`libiio iio_reg` command reads or writes SPI or I2C registers in an
IIO device. This is
generally not needed for end applications but can be useful in debugging
drivers. Note that you need to specify a context using the *-u*
qualifier when you are not directly accessing the device via RPI or when
you are using the ADICUP3029 platform.

  .. code-block::

   analog@analog:~$ iio_reg -u <context> <device> <register> [<value>]

Example:

 - To read the device ID (register = 0x02) of an AD5592R interfaced via
   RPI from a Windows machine, enter the following code on the terminal:

    .. code-block:: 
      
      iio_reg -u ip: ad5592r 0x02

IIO Oscilloscope
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. caution:: 
   
   Make sure to download/update to the latest version of IIO-Oscilloscope
   found on this :git-iio-oscilloscope:`link <releases+>`

#. Once done with the installation or an update of the latest
   IIO-Oscilloscope, open the application. The user needs to supply a
   URI which will be used in the context creation of the IIO
   Oscilloscope and the instructions can be seen in the previous
   section.

#. Press refresh to display available IIO Devices, once ad5592r
   appeared, press connect.

attributes of the device.

PyADI-IIO
~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`pyadi-iio` is a Python abstraction module for ADI hardware with IIO
drivers to make them easier to use. This module provides device-specific APIs
built on top of the current libIIO Python bindings. These interfaces try to
match the driver naming as much as possible without the need to understand the
complexities of libIIO and IIO.

Follow the step-by-step procedure on how to install, configure, and set
up PyADI-IIO and install the necessary packages/modules needed by
referring to the :ref:`pyadi-iio` documentation.

Running the example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After installing and configuring PYADI-IIO in your machine, you are now
ready to run Python script examples. In our case, run the
:git-pyadi-iio:`ad5592r_example.py <blob/master/examples/ad5592r_example.py+>`
found in the examples folder.

.. code-block:: 

    D:\pyadi-iio\examples>python ad5592r_example.py 

Press enter. Input desired voltage levels and you will get these
readings.
