General Description
-------------------

The EV-ADAQ7768-1FMC1Z evaluation kit features the ADAQ7768-1, a 24-bit,
single-channel precision data acquisition system (DAQ) �Module� system. The
evaluation board demonstrates the performance of the ADAQ7768-1 �Module and is a
versatile tool for a variety of applications.

The EV-ADAQ7768-1FMC1Z board connects to the USB port of the PC through the
system demonstration platform (SDP-H1). By default, all the necessary supply
rails on the EV-ADAQ7768-1FMC1Z are powered by a 3.3 V rail coming from the
SDP-H1. The 3.3 V rail is regulated by the on-board power solution to �15 V and
5.3 V to power the ADAQ7768-1 and its support components.

The EV-ADAQ7768-1FMC1Z is used alongside a downloadable evaluation software
(ACE) that fully configures the ADAQ7768-1 device register functionality, and
also provides DC and AC time and frequency domain analysis in the form of
waveform graphs, histograms, and associated noise analysis for ADC performance
evaluation. The ACE software controls the EV-ADAQ7768-1FMC1Z over the USB
through the system demonstration platform (SDPH1).

The ADAQ7768-1 data sheet provides a full description and complete
specifications of the ADAQ7768-1. Consult it in conjunction with this user guide
when using the evaluation board. Full details on the SDP-H1 are available on the

Power Supplies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The evaluation board requires 3.3V power supply to operate. By default, the 3.3V
rail is supplied by the SDP-H1, and the SDP-H1 is powered by a 12V wall adapter.
The terminal block P14, can also be used to supply the evaluation board with
3.3V in case the user prefers to evaluate the EV-ADAQ7768-1FMC1Z with a
third-party capture board.

The EV-ADAQ7768-1FMC1Z uses LT3095 (U2), a dual channel integrated boost and LDO
regulator in a single package. LT3095 generates the +15V needed by the VDD_PGA
pin of ADAQ7768-1 and a 5.3V to supply the built-in LDO of ADAQ7768-1. The LDO
of the ADAQ7768-1 is used to power the VDD2_PGA, VDD_FDA, VDD_ADC, VDD2_ADC, and
the ADR4540 reference device as shown on ADAQ7768-1 Datasheet Quick Start Up
Guide.

ADP2300 (U1) is used to scale the 3.3V from SDP-H1 to -16V, while ADP7182 (U3)  a low noise LDO, regulates the voltage to -15V which is used by the VSS_PGA.

The 3.3V from SDP-H1 is also used to supply the power needed on the VDD_IO.

Startup Sequence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After running the software, the following sequence of event occurs:

-  The software accesses the EPPROM on the main evaluation board, which contains the board ID
-  Once the EEPROM value is verified, the PC loads the corresponding firmware to the FPGA on the SDP-H1.
-  After the loading of the firmware, the SDP-H1 supplies the 3.3V to the main evaluation board and establishes communication with the DUT.
-  The software then loads a preset of register values to the DUTs user
   register map to configure the DUT to the tools default operating mode.

Description of the Analysis Window
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Click **Proceed to Analysis** in the chip view window to open the window shown in Figure 7. The **Analysis** view window allows the user to showcase the performance of the EV-ADAQ7768-1FMC1Z. Before performing any measurements, set the capture settings (see the CAPTURE SETTINGS section) and analysis settings (see the ANALYSIS section).

The **Analysis** view window contains the **Waveform** tab (see Figure 8), the **Histogram** tab (see Figure 9), and the **FFT** tab (see Figure 10).

Capture Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The General Capture Settings allows the user to configure the Sample Count and
the ODR (Output Data Rate). These settings reflect in the registers
automatically before data capture.

The **Sample Count** enables the user to select the number of samples per capture. The default value is set at 8192 samples, which can also be changed to the selection of the dropdown list, ranging from 512 to 131072 samples.

The **ODR (Output Data Rate)** is automatically calculated by the software based on the selected ADC filter settings. By default, this is set to 256 kSPS.

Click **Run Once** in the **Capture Settings** section to start a data capture of the samples at the sample rate specified in the **Sample Count** dropdown list. These samples are stored on the FPGA device and are only transferred to the PC when the sample frame is complete.

Click **Run Continuously** in the **Capture Settings** section to start a data capture that gathers samples continuously with one batch of data at a time. This operation runs the **Run Once** operation continuously.

Analysis
^^^^^^^^

The **General Settings** section allows the user to set up the preferred configuration of the FFT analysis. This configuration sets the number of tones to be analyzed and the fundamental strategy to be used.

The **Windowing** section allows the user to set up the preferred windowing type to use in the FFT analysis. Other parameters that must be included in the analysis (i.e., number of harmonics, fundamental bins, harmonic bins, DC bins and worst other bins) can also be configured.

The **Single Tone Analysis** and the **Two-Tone Analysis** sections sets up the fundamental frequencies included in the FFT analysis. When one frequency is analyzed, use the **Single Tone Analysis** section. When two frequencies are analyzed, use the **Two-Tone Analysis** section.

Results
^^^^^^^

Click **Export** to export the captured data. The waveform, histogram, and FFT data is stored in .xml files along with the values of the parameters at capture.

--------------

Waveform Tab
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The **Waveform** tab displays data in form of time vs. discrete data values with the results, as shown in Figure 8.

The data waveform graph shows each successive sample of the �Module output. The
user can zoom in on and pan over the waveform graph using the embedded waveform
tools above the graph.

Click the display units dropdown list (shown with the **Codes** option selected in Figure 8) to select whether the data graph displays in units of hexadecimal, volts, or codes. The axis controls are dynamic.

When selecting either y-scale dynamic or x-scale dynamic, the corresponding axis
width automatically adjusts to show the entire range of the �Module results
after each batch of samples.

Exiting the Software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To exit the software, click file icon on the upper right tab and then click
Exit.

Configuring the Board
---------------------

Input Range Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two ways to control the DUT input range.

-  Through the GPIO of the DUT, controlled over the SPI interface.
-  Through on-board mechanical switch S2.

By default, the ACE software uses the GPIO to control the input range. The user can configure the PGIA gain by clicking the PGIA icon in the **Chip View** of the ACE software to select the input ranges. Once done, the user must click **Apply Changes** located at the upper left corner in order for the PGIA gain to take effect.

The user needs to set S2 switches to LO in order to properly control the device
input range using GPIO.

.. container:: centeralign

   |Figure 12. Input range selection menu|\ *Figure 12. Input range selection menu*

Alternatively, the user can choose to select the input range through an onboard mechanical switch S2. For this to work, check the **Control PGIA with switch** in the PGIA Gain section. Then, click the **Apply Changes** for this to take effect.

.. container:: centeralign

   |Figure 13. Input range mode selection| *Figure 13. Input range mode selection*

The user can then control the input range setting using switch S2, see Table 3
for more details. Note, when choosing the manual input range control option, the
user is responsible of adjusting the Gain Mode Setting in the software
accordingly in order for the software to display the correct measurement result.

Input Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Provide the input signal through screw terminal or the SMB connectors.

The default board inputs are floating with high impedance. The user needs to
ensure the source signal is properly biased to a common mode voltage.

The true dynamic range of the board can be measured by connect the two inputs to
the boards ground reference through the screw terminal by a short piece of
wire.

Configuring the DUT
-------------------

The default configuration sets the DUT with the wideband low ripple (brick wall) filter with ODR=256ksps. The user can see the result by clicking **Proceed to Analysis > Run Once** button in the Chip View of the software.

Refer to the ADAQ7768-1 datasheet for more information on the DUT register
configuration.

The ADAQ7768-1 has excellent performance in both AC and DC measurement. The
digital filter inside the ADAQ7768-1 can be programmed with a wide range of
decimation ratios to achieve input bandwidth from a few Hertz to a maximum of
204kHz.

AC Measurement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, the software configures the DUT to perform wide bandwidth
measurement with the wideband low ripple digital filter (brick wall) of 110kHz
of -3dB BW.

In this mode the user can evaluate the wide band dynamic range (noise) as well
as other AC performances such as SNR, THD and SFDR etc.

The user can also test the devices anti-aliasing performance by sweeping an out
of band signal to the input across frequency.

DC Measurement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Sinc3 filter with ODR=50SPS is a sweet spot for the measurement of a pure DC
signal. As the Sinc notch appears at 50Hz and can be used to reject the 50Hz
line frequency. Take the following steps to setup the DUT for a 50SPS Sinc3
filter:

-  As an example for RMS noise, short IN- and IN+ connectors to ground.
-  At the Chip View of the ACE software, click the **Filter Configuration** icon.
-  Use the drop-down menu to select **Sinc3** (programmable decimation rate) option as shown in Figure 16.
-  Configure the **Sinc3 Decimation Rate** by typing in the value **13FF** in the text box near the lower right corner as shown in Figure 17. This is also reflected in the registers SINC3_DEC_RATE_LSB and SINC3_DEC\_ RATE_MSB located at the memory map of the ACE software (see Figure 18). Afterwards, click **Apply Changes** for this to take effect.

-  Before clicking on the **Run Once** button, make sure to adjust the number of samples to be collected accordingly.

.. container:: centeralign

   |image27| *Figure 19. Change the number of samples to collect per sample run*

-  Collecting the default 8192 samples at 50SPS will take 8192\*1/50/60=2.73 minutes! Start with 1024 samples, which should take about 20 seconds. Generate new capture using 1024 samples.

-  The same condition (Sinc3 50SPS) is used to measure Low Frequency Noise, as specified in the datasheet. In the **Histogram** tab, noise is displayed as Transition noise in LSB. To compare with datasheets referred to input (RTI) Low Frequency Noise in �Vrms, apply the formula:

-  For example, using Gain2 Mode (AFE_GAIN = 1.3 V/V) with measured Transition
   Noise = 1.508 LSB = 0.566 �Vrms RTI.

Calculating SINC3_DEC_RATE Value
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| For a 16.384 MHz MCLK to achieve an ODR of 50 Hz using the Sinc3 filter, use the following equation and determine the DEC_RATE:

.. container:: centeralign

   :math:`ODR = Mclk/MclkDiv \times DecRate`

With the ADAQ7768-1 MCLK_DIV = 2,

.. container:: centeralign

   :math:`DecRate = Mclk/MclkDiv \times ODR = 163,840`

To program the Sinc3 decimation ratio, the user must first calculate for the
equivalent Sinc3 decimation ratio to be written on SINC3_DECIMATION_RATE
registers (SINC3_DEC_RATE_MSB and SINC3_DEC_RATE_LSB) using the equation below:

.. container:: centeralign

   :math:`Equivalent DecRate = DecRate/32 -1 = 5119`

To set the decimation ration to 163,840, write the equivalent hexadecimal value
of 5119 to SINC3_DEC_RATE_MSB and SINC3_DEC_RATE_LSB registers because the value
in the register is incremented by 1 and then multiplied by 32 to give the actual
decimation rate.

Refer to the ADAQ7768-1 datasheet for more information on the DUT register
configuration.

Reset Switches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Press S1 switch to reset the DUT. Resetting the DUT will reset all the register
settings to its default value.

A reset switch is also available on the SDP-H1 to reset the interface board.
Resetting the digital interface board will result in losing communication with
the DUT.

The user can restart the software tool to re-initialize the board.
