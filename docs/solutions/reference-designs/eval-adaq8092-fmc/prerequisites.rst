.. _adaq8092 prerequisites:

Prerequisites
===============================================================================

What you need, depends on what you are trying to do. As a minimum, you need to
start out with:

Hardware prerequisites
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#. The ADAQ8092-based evaluation board: :adi:`EVAL-ADAQ8092`
#. An FPGA carrier platform. Our recommended one can be found
   :ref:`here <adaq8092 carriers>`.

   - There are a few more boards, which do work, but are currently not
     supported by us. The experience with the fabric-only solutions is very
     close to the ARM/FPGA SoC based solutions, but the GUI runs on a host PC
     (Windows or Linux).

#. Some way to interact with the FPGA platform:

   #. for the ARM/FPGA SoC platforms, this normally includes:

      - Micro-USB cable for UART console
      - LAN cable (Ethernet) for SSH or IIO applications
      - HDMI or DisplayPort monitor (Optional)
      - USB Keyboard (Optional)
      - USB Mouse (Optional)

   #. for the FPGA-only, this includes:

      - LAN cable (Ethernet)
      - Host PC (Windows or Linux)
      - Micro-USB cable for UART
      - Micro-USB cable for JTAG (PROG)

#. Internet connection (without proxies makes things much easier) to update the
   scripts/binaries on the SD card that came with the ADI FMC Card (firewalls
   are OK, proxies make things a pain).
#. Test equipment for generating analog input signals and a clock source for
   the ADC clock input.
#. An SD card with at least 16GB of memory (in case you're using Linux). You
   should have received one when purchasing the evaluation board.

Software prerequisites
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Normally, for basic functionalities regarding visualizing the data received
from the FPGA, we use the following:

#. :external+scopy:doc:`Scopy <index>` v2.0 or later (must contain the IIO plugin)
#. :git-iio-oscilloscope:`IIO Oscilloscope <releases+>`
#. UART terminal application (PuTTY/TeraTerm/Minicom), 115200 8N1

.. note::

   :adi:`ADI <>` does not offer FPGA carrier platforms for sale or loan; getting
   one yourself is the normal part of development or evaluation.
