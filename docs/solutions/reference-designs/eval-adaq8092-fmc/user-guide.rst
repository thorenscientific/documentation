====================================

General Description
-------------------

| The :adi:`EVAL-ADAQ8092-FMCZ <EVAL-ADAQ8092>` evaluates the :adi:`ADAQ8092`, a 14-bit, 105MSPS, high-speed dual-channel data acquisition uModule solution. This device uses System-in-Package (SiP) technology that integrates three common signal processing and conditioning blocks.
| This :adi:`EVAL-ADAQ8092-FMCZ <EVAL-ADAQ8092>` board does not need an external power supply to operate and requires a very small jitter in the clock source.

Board Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Figure 2** shows the EVAL-ADAQ8092-FMCZ block diagram. The ADAQ8092 µModule that is soldered to the EVAL-ADAQ8092-FMC does not require external supply to power-up the board. It uses the +12V supply source from the data capture board such as Zedboard and activates the LDO’s to provide the 3.3V and 1.8V needed of the board.

Analog Inputs

   \ **Figure 3. Analog Input Circuitry of EVAL-ADAQ8092-FMCZ**

   | The EVAL-ADAQ8092-FMCZ provides the user to either use a single-ended or differential source. For the single-ended source, user can either use the balun so that the part will still be driven differentially or bypass it to drive the part single-endedly. Installation of 0Ω resistor is used to configure the input of the analog input circuitry.

**Table 1. Factory Default Settings (Single-ended input driven)**

.. important::

   Note: Without changing other resistor values of the board, then this board is
   ready for a single ended source that drives the part single-endedly. But if
   the user uses a differential source, then install 49.9Ω resistors at R1 and
   R3 for Channel 1 and Channel 2, respectively. These should be implemented to
   properly balance the inputs when driven differentially. Refer to Figure 6 and
   Figure 7 for the schematic.Table 2. Differentially driven using the balun

   Note: When using this configuration, resistor values should also be changed
   to properly balance the impedance and make the gain approximately equal to 5.
   For channel 1: R8 & R9 = 200 Ω, and, R14 & R16 = 18.2Ω. For channel 2: R10 &
   R11 = 200Ω, and, R15 & R17 = 18.2Ω. Refer to Figure 6 and Figure 7 for
   schematic.*

Encode Circuitry

   \ **Figure 4. Encode Circuitry of EVAL-ADAQ8092-FMCZ**

| The user can either use a single-ended encode mode or a differential encode mode. The default configuration of the EVAL-ADAQ8092-FMCZ uses the single-ended encode mode that requires a CMOS level. Also, the board provides an option to install an oscillator (Y1) and use it as a built-in clock for a single-ended encode mode.
| When using a sinusoidal, PECL or LVDS signal then it is suggested to use the differential encode mode.

Power Circuitry

.. container:: centeralign

   \ **Figure 5. Power Circuitry of EVAL-ADAQ8092-FMCZ**

| The EVAL-ADAQ8092-FMC uses the +12V supply from the data capture board such as Zed board at C35 of the FMC (FPGA Mezzanine Card) connector pin configuration. This +12V supply goes to a reverse input protection by the used of LTC4359 (U2) and then proceed with a step down regulator, LTM8074 (U4). The output of the LTM8074 which is configured to have 5V output will then supply the LTC1673-1.8 (U3) and LTC1763-3.3 (VR1). The LTC1763-1.8 will be VDD and OVDD supplies, while the LTC1763-3.3 will be the VCC supply.
| External supplies can also be used when some of the built-in power circuitry is failing. Re-work of the board is needed to achieve this.

Setting up the board
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Figure 8** illustrates the evaluation system components. To use the system, here's the following steps:

-  Connect the evaluation board to the ZedBoard. Ensure that there's an SD card installed on it.
-  Connect the CLK divider (DC1075B) to the evaluation board
-  Connect a micro-USB cable to the USB OTG port
-  Apply power to the ZedBoard and to the DC1075
-  Open the ACE software
-  Apply the desire CLK and input signal
-  Start the evaluation

Controller Board
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ZedBoard, which is the system controller board, enables the configuration of
the ADC and capture of data from the evaluation board by the PC via USB (or
Ethernet). The ADAQ8092 support a multi-lane serial port interface (SPI) for
each data converter channel. The SPI interface for each channel is connected to
the ZedBoard via the FMC connector (P1). The ZedBoard™ functions as the
communication link between the PC and connected evaluation board. It buffers
samples captured from the evaluation board in its DDR3 memory. The ZedBoard
board requires power from a 12 volt wall adapter (included with the ZedBoard).
It hosts a Xilinx® ZYNQ® 7020 SoC, which contains two ARM® Cortex-A9 Processors
and a Series-7 FPGA with 85k Programmable Logic cells. A Linux OS runs on the
host processor system. It communicates with the PC through either a USB 2.0 high
speed port or a 10/100/1000 Ethernet port. The default software configuration
uses USB.

Software Support
----------------

The ADI ACE application provides a ‘plug and play’ evaluation experience, enabling users to get up and running quickly with the product evaluation board. ACE can configure the embedded software on supported controller boards and provides a quick and easy way to get setup, configure the board and perform data capture and analysis and/or waveform generation. For ACE installation and documentation instructions see :adi:`ACE`. Make sure to follow the instructions to install the necessary evaluation board plug-in support.

-  If the machine that ACE is installed on has internet access, you can
   find/install/update plug-ins directly from the ACE application. For
   environments without internet access, you can download these plug-ins from
   the previous link to portable storage and install them into ACE.

.. note::

   Product specific documentation for the evaluation software can be found
   within the ACE plug-in. The controller board supported by ACE with this
   product evaluation board is the ZedBoard™.

Software Operation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To start the ACE evaluation software, here are the following steps:

-  1. Open the ACE software.
-  2. In the **Start** window, wait until the software recognizes the **"ADAQ8092 Board"** as an attached hardware, and then double-click on it to go to the "ADAQ8092 Board" window (refer to **Figure 9**).

Analysis
~~~~~~~~

Here in the **ANALYSIS** window, there are three (3) panes, the **CAPTURE** pane, **ANALYSIS** pane, and **RESULTS** pane.

-  In the CAPTURE pane, the user can change the sample count up to 65536 and the sample frequency used is shown. At the bottom, the user can capture data once by clicking "Run Once" or continuously by clicking "Run Continuously". *Note: Use "Run Continuously" when capturing the Average FFT, INL, and DNL.*
-  In the ANALYSIS pane, the user can change the "windowing" type of the FFT, and also the "average iterations" when capturing the INL and DNL performance. When measuring the INL and DNL, the user should use the "Run Continuously" function and wait until it reaches the number of "average iterations" placed.
-  In the RESULTS pane, this is where the parametric values will be displayed.
   At the bottom of it, the user can import or export the data.
