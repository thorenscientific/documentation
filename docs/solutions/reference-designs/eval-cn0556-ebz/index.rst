EVAL-CN0556-EBZ
===============

Programmable High Current and Voltage Source/Sink Power Supply.

Overview
--------

The :adi:`EVAL-CN0556-EBZ <CN0556>` is a programmable buck or boost power
supply featuring an adjustable buck output of 2V to 14V, 35A, and
adjustable boost output of 14V to 56V, 10A. The design allows the mode of
operation to externally controlled or automatically selected. Six independent
control loops regulate input and output voltage in both directions, as well as
provide input and output current limit programming and monitoring.

The system input and output voltages and currents are monitored and controlled
through analog I/O. Using an analog I/O module, a single board computer such
as a Raspberry Pi platform can receive telemetry information to control the
board remotely.

Software Setup
--------------

The input and output voltages and current limits of the :adi:`CN0556`
can be controlled through software. Interfacing :adi:`CN0556` with the
:adi:`CN0554` analog I/O module enables full control capability. For
the device to run, the SD card should be loaded with Analog Devices Kuiper
Linux, a distribution based on Raspbian from the Raspberry Pi Foundation. It
incorporates Linux device drivers for ADI products as well as tools and other
software products designed and created with ease of use in mind. The reasoning
behind creating this distribution is to minimize the barriers to integrating ADI
hardware devices into a Linux-based embedded system.

Access to the embedded system can be through a remote PC connected either via
LAN cable or Wi-Fi.

Downloading and Flashing ADI Kuiper Linux Image on SD Card
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to control the EVAL-CN0556-EBZ from the Raspberry Pi, you need to install ADI
Kuiper Linux on an SD card. Complete instructions, including where to download
the SD card image, how to write it to the SD card, and how to configure the
system are provided at :ref:`Kuiper Images <kuiper>`.

.. figure:: command_prompt.png

There is an available Wiki Page which explains in detail on how to download
and flash the SD card using Windows or Linux OS: 'Configuring the SD Card
for Raspberry Pi Projects' in the
:dokuwiki:`Formatting and Flashing SD Cards using Windows </resources/tools-software/linux-software/zynq_images/windows_hosts>`.

Configuring the SD Card for CN0556
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the Linux kernel to identify the device connected to the expansion header, 
update the device tree overlay. A Device Tree Overlay contains information about 
additional connected hardware, the EVAL-CN0556-EBZ for this case. The overlay file 
is already included in the SD card and just needs to be matched to the EVAL-CN0556-EBZ.

Follow :external+kuiper:ref:`hardware-configuration-raspberry-pi`,
substituting the following lines in **config.txt**.

This brings up the file in the terminal. Scroll down until the line that
begins with ``dtoverlay`` is found; then, whatever it currently is, change
it to:

::

   dtoverlay=rpi-cn0556

Running the Example Scripts using PyADI-IIO
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`pyadi-iio` is a python abstraction module for ADI hardware with IIO
drivers to make them easier to use. This module provides device-specific APIs
built on top of the current libIIO python bindings. These interfaces try to
match the driver naming as much as possible without the need to understand the
complexities of libIIO and IIO.

Follow the step-by-step procedure on how to install, configure, and set up
PyADI-IIO and all necessary packages and modules found in :ref:`pyadi-iio`.

Hardware Configuration
----------------------

Jumper Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Using 3.3V from the on-board LDO**

At P1, check if the shunt placed is in correct position. The shunt should be
placed correctly to short Pins 3 and 4. If it is not in proper placement, move
the shunt to the correct position before performing the rest of the tests.

**Disabling Current Sharing Capability**

The CN0556 enables a masterless fault-tolerant mechanism for sharing output
current, following below configuration:

+------------------+----------------------------------------+-----------------+
| Share Capability | ISHARE pin                             | IGND pin        |
+==================+========================================+=================+
| **ENABLED**      | ISHARE shorted to IGND with RSHARE     |                 |
|                  | resistor in between                    |                 |
+------------------+----------------------------------------+-----------------+
| **DISABLED**     | Shorted to INTVCC                      | Shorted to AGND |
+------------------+----------------------------------------+-----------------+

By default, this capability is **disabled** in CN0556.

- Shunt must be placed on P5 to short ISHARE to INTVCC

- Solder jumper P6 is **OPEN** by default to disconnect ISHARE to IGND:

-  Solder jumper P7 is **SHORTED** by default to short IGND to AGND:

.. warning::
   The following steps involve high DC voltages.
   Follow instructions carefully to prevent hot plugging, which may damage
   the device by an overvoltage transient.

#. Prepare a bench top power supply, electronic load, and two digital
   multimeters.

#. Proceed to
   **Running the Buck Mode Example Script** section for step-by-step 
   instructions on how to get measurements.

Running the Buck Mode Example Script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. tip::
   By default, the example script sets the board into Buck Mode and sets its
   parameters to its maximum values. You may try to adjust the values after this test. 
   Refer to the table of ranges appropriate for each control function.

#. Ensure that the power supply is at the V1 left side and the electronic load
   is at the V2 right side.
#. Once the Raspberry Pi 4 has finished booting, open the command prompt or
   terminal and navigate through the examples folder inside the downloaded or
   cloned pyadi-iio directory.
#. Turn on the power supply and the electronic load.
#. Set the power supply at V1 left side to **56V** and set the current limit to
   **2A**. *Do not enable the power supply yet*.
#. Set the electronic load at the right side to **0.1A**.
#. Enable the electronic load.
#. Navigate into the cn0556_examples folder inside the *pyadi-iio > examples*
   directory.
#. Run the example script using the command:

   .. shell::

      ~/pyadi-iio/examples/cn0556_examples
      $ python cn0556_example_buck.py

#. The details of the current and voltage set at the output will be displayed.
   
   .. figure:: pyadi-iio_buck_1.png

#. Enable the output of the power supply into the V1 terminals.
#. Check the DMM at the output V2 side. It should read approximately 14V.
#. If the reading is not 14V (or almost 0V), try to slowly increase the input
   DC voltage at V1 to up to 58V. Once the output is 14V, decrease the input
   voltage at V1 to 56V again.
#. Once the power supply is enabled, and the DMM reads approx. 14V, press the
   **ENTER** key.
   
   .. figure:: pyadi-iio_buck_2.png

#. The input and output voltage and current at the V1 and V2 side will be
   printed in the command window.
#. The board will continuously regulate the output voltage to 14V unless CN0556
   is turned off.
#. Press **ENTER** to disable and turn off the board.
#. Turn off the power supply and the electronic load. Make sure that the
   settings of the power supply are at 0V and 0A limit, as well as the
   electronic load to 0A.
