AD-JUPITER-EBZ
==============

Software-Defined Radio.

Overview
--------

Jupiter is a versatile software-defined platform based on Analog Devices
:adi:`ADRV9002` and
:xilinx:`AMD Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC. <products/adaptive-socs-and-fpgas/soc/zynq-ultrascale-plus-mpsoc.html>`
:adi:`ADRV9002` is a new generation RF transceiver that has dual-channel
transmitters, dual-channel receivers covering 30 MHz to 6 GHz frequency 
range with very good RF linearity performance and a set of advanced 
features like fast profiles switching, flexible power vs performance 
configuration, fast frequency hopping, multi-chip synchronization and 
DPD for narrow and wide band waveform. The evaluation platform includes
XCZU3EG processing device that has a wide range of interfaces making the
system capable of local processing or streaming to a remote host. It 
comes integrated in a self-contained ruggedised aluminum case which 
gives flexibility in evaluating and prototyping across different 
environments.

The platform comes with open-source software that includes:

- Linux and no-OS
- HDL reference design
- IIO
- MATLAB
- GNU Radio
- Python

Downloads
---------

Binaries:

Osc for windows can be downloaded directly from Github. Go to to the following link and download the latest release.

 - :git-iio-oscilloscope:`IIO-Scope <releases+>`

The latest boot files for adrv9002 (for all supported carriers) can be found in the latest Kuiper Image release (note one can choose between downloading the full image or just the boot partition):

 - :dokuwiki:`Kuiper Image <resources/tools-software/linux-software/adi-kuiper_images/release_notes#release_image>`

Below it's an experimental pre-release which enables DMA Coherency on the AXI DMA core. That means the IP core can snoop the caches and so samples can actually live in them. This gave some promising throughput improvements when using libiio IP and USB backends:
