EVAL-CN0554-RPIZ
================

±10 V Analog Input and ±15 V Analog Output for Raspberry Pi Platforms.

The :adi:`EVAL-CN0554-RPIZ` is a flexible, general-purpose 
multichannel mixed-signal analog input/output (I/O) module. 
The 16 single-ended analog outputs are software configurable, 
with ranges of 0 V to 5 V, ±5 V, 0 V to 10 V, and ±15 V. 
Eight channels of fully differential analog input are 
provided with hardware selectable input ranges of ±2.5 V and ±25 V.
The circuit is designed to mount directly on top of a Raspberry Pi,
providing this popular single board computer an analog input/output
interface. Software control is accessible through the Linux industrial
input/output (IIO) framework.

Running the System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To set up the complete system, follow these steps:

#. Connect the
   :adi:`EVAL-CN0554-RPIZ` to the
   Raspberry Pi through the 40-pin connector.

    .. figure:: 13_-_cn0554_attached_to_raspberry_pi.jpg

       EVAL-CN0554-RPIZ Attached to Raspberry Pi 4

#. Insert the SD card with the correct ADI Kuiper Linux image to the
   Raspberry Pi 4 Model B.

#. Connect the corresponding ADC input and DAC output channel using the
   female-to-female loopback jumper cables as shown in the connection
   diagram and image below.

    .. figure:: 14_-_cn0554_loopback_diagram.png

       EVAL-CN0554-RPIZ Test Setup with Loopback Connection

#. Connect HDMI of the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B to the display monitor,
   and then connect the keyboard and mouse to any of the former’s USB
   ports.

#. Power the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B using the USB Type-C power adapter
   and wait for the Raspberry Pi to boot up.

       EVAL-CN0554-RPIZ System Test Setup

#. Open IIO Oscilloscope and undock the DMM and Debug tabs as shown
   below.

   *IIO Oscilloscope DMM and Debug Tabs*

#. In the DMM Window, select the **ad7124** as the device and select a
   channel to measure, such as **ad7124-8:voltage0-voltage 1**. Click on
   the Play button to start the measurement.

    .. figure:: 17_-_iio_oscilloscope_cn0554_dmm.png

       IIO Oscilloscope DMM Window

#. In the Debug Window, select **ltc2688** in Device Selection. In the
   IIO Device Attributes section, select **output voltage1** channel and
   select **raw** attribute. Set the value to **32768** and click
   **Write**. This should set the output voltage to around 2.5 V which
   is half of the default output range of 0 to 5 V.

#. The DMM measurement should show approximately 0.227 V or 1/11 of 2.5
   V which is the default input voltage attenuation.

Software Setup
--------------

For the device to run, the SD card should be loaded with Analog Devices
Kuiper Linux, a distribution based on Raspbian from the Raspberry Pi
Foundation. It incorporates Linux device drivers for ADI products as
well as tools and other software products designed and created with ease
of use in mind. The reasoning behind creating this distribution is to
minimize the barriers to integrating ADI hardware devices into a
Linux-based embedded system.

Access to the embedded system can be through a remote PC connected either via
LAN cable or Wi-Fi.

Downloading and Flashing Kuiper Linux Image on SD Card
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to control the :adi:`EVAL-CN0554-RPIZ` from the Raspberry Pi, you will
need to install ADI Kuiper Linux on an SD card. Complete instructions,
including where to download the SD card image, how to write it to the SD card,
and how to configure the system are provided at
:external+kuiper:doc:`index`. Write the image and follow the system
configuration procedure.

.. figure:: command_prompt.png
   :align: center

Configuring the SD Card for the CN0554
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the Linux kernel to identify the device connected to the expansion
header, update the device tree overlay. A **Device Tree Overlay**
contains information about additional connected hardware, the
EVAL-CN0554-RPIZ for this case. The overlay file is already included in
the SD card and just needs to be matched to the EVAL-CN0554-RPIZ.

Follow the Hardware Configuration procedure under **Preparing the Image:
Raspberry Pi** in the :external+kuiper:doc:`index` page, substituting
the following lines in **config.txt**:

This brings up the file in the terminal. Scroll down until the line that
begins with “dtoverlay” is found; then, whatever it currently is, change
it to:

.. note::

    **Need to add overlay here since it isn’t in Kuiper**

    *dtoverlay=rpi-cn0554*

Save the file by Ctrl + X command. Reboot the system by typing on the
command prompt:

.. shell::

   $ sudo reboot

Graphical User Interface (GUI) and Example Python Scripts
---------------------------------------------------------

There are two main tools which a user has the option to interact with
the :adi:`EVAL-CN0554-RPIZ`.

- :ref:`iio-oscilloscope`
- :ref:`pyadi-iio`

Software Control and Diagnostics via IIO Oscilloscope
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :adi:`EVAL-CN0554-RPIZ` can be evaluated using IIO Oscilloscope.
Customers can use the debug tab and the DMM tab. Various controls
and diagnostics are available in these plug-ins.

Debug Tab
^^^^^^^^^

The debug tab provides direct access to IIO device and channel
attributes, as well as the registers of the
:adi:`EVAL-CN0554-RPIZ` components. The IIO attributes and
registers can be read and written for advanced configuration
and information.

DMM Tab
^^^^^^^

The DMM tab provides the ADC readings for the :adi:`AD7124-8`.

PyADI-IIO
~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`pyadi-iio` is a python abstraction module for ADI hardware with IIO
drivers to make them easier to use. This module provides device-specific APIs
built on top of the current libIIO python bindings. These interfaces try to
match the driver naming as much as possible without the need to understand the
complexities of libIIO and IIO.

Running the Example
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This demo uses a PyADI-IIO example script. This script will show the
single-tone frequency with calibrated output power in dBm.

1. Connect the :adi:`EVAL-CN0554-RPIZ` to the Raspberry Pi.

2. Open command prompt or terminal and navigate through the examples
   folder inside the downloaded or cloned *pyadi-iio* directory.

3. Run the example script using the command.

.. code-block::

   …/pyadi-iio/examples $ python3 cn0554_example.py

.. note::

   **Update image, file name, and location**
