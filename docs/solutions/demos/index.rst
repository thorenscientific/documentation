Demos!
========================

What is a "Demo?"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here's what ChatGPT has to say:


*"A trade show demo is a live presentation or demonstration of a product or service at a trade show or exhibition. The goal is to showcase the features, benefits, and functionality of the product to potential customers, partners, and industry professionals. Here are some key aspects of a trade show demo:*

 - *Engagement: A good demo captures the audience's attention and keeps them engaged. This can be achieved through interactive elements, such as hands-on experiences or live demonstrations.*

 - *Education: It educates the audience about the product, explaining how it works and how it can solve specific problems or meet their needs*

 - *Brand Awareness: It helps build brand awareness by introducing the company and its offerings to a broader audience*

 - *Lead Generation: A successful demo can generate leads by attracting potential customers who are interested in learning more or making a purchase*

 - *Feedback: It provides an opportunity to gather feedback from attendees, which can be valuable for improving the product or refining marketing strategies*

*Trade show demos are a vital part of marketing strategies for many companies, as they offer a unique opportunity to connect with a targeted audience in a dynamic and interactive environment.*


A more subtle aspect of a good demo is that it should "make sense" and be either built from existing components, or justify the creation of new components that will be used in the future.

Here is an example of a truly excellent demo, showing the CN0503 Optical Liquid Analysis Platform at the SPIE Photonics West conference:

Why is is so great? Not only does it meet all of the objectives above, all of the hardware components are available, and all of the software components are available and open-source.
