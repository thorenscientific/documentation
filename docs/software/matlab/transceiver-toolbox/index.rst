Transceiver Toolbox
===================

.. note::

   This section only gives an overview on the Transceiver Toolbox,
   for all details, see
   `the dedicated doc <https://analogdevicesinc.github.io/TransceiverToolbox/master>`__.

Analog Devices Transceiver Toolbox For MATLAB and Simulink is a
set of tools to model, interface, and target with ADI
transceiver devices within MATLAB and Simulink. These are combined into single
Toolbox which contains a set of Board Support Packages (BSP). The list of
supported boards is provided
:dokuwiki:`here <resources/eval/user-guides/matlab_bsp#supported_boards>`.

Quick Start with Toolbox
------------------------

The current stable Toolbox can be downloaded from the
:git-TransceiverToolbox:`releases+`.
Download the latest mltbx file then open that file within MATLAB. Opening the
file will automatically install the Toolbox, adding the necessary components to
your MATLAB path. The "Analog Devices, Inc. Transceiver Toolbox" will appear in
your :mw:`Add-Ons Explore <help/matlab/matlab_env/manage-your-add-ons.html>`
within MATLAB.

To interface and stream data with hardware will require installation of
:ref:`libiio`
and one of two Hardware Support Packages from MathWorks. The libiio library can
The libiio library can be obtained on :git-libiio:`/` page
of the project.

Toolbox Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Depending on your needs, different toolboxes will be required. For basic data
streaming into MATLAB or Simulink only the following MathWorks toolboxes are
required:

-  :mw:`Communications Toolbox <products/communications/>`
-  :mw:`DSP System Toolbox <products/dsp-system/>`
-  :mw:`Signal Processing Toolbox <products/signal/>`
-  :mw:`SoC Blockset <products/soc.html>`

Models of different transceivers may require different toolboxes as well. More
information can be found :dokuwiki:`at the RF Blockset Model of AD9361 from MathWorks page </resources/eval/user-guides/ad-fmcomms2-ebz/software/simrf>`.

API Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See at `Latest Transceiver Toolbox API doc <https://analogdevicesinc.github.io/TransceiverToolbox/master>`__

Building the Toolbox Manually
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The toolbox can only be built under Linux or with Cygwin on a Windows platform.
Conveniently, the entire process is automated with a Makefile located in the
CI/scripts folder of the repository. The following is required on the system
before the build process can be run:

-  A supported MATLAB version installed in the default location
   (*/usr/local/MATLAB*)
-  A supported Vivado version installed in the default location
   (*/opt/Xilinx*)
-  Packages: git zip unzip tar make wget sed

.. warning::

   You should only manually build the toolbox if you require a custom
   branch or no toolbox installer is available

First clone the repo and move into it:

.. shell::

   $git clone https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/TransceiverToolbox.git \
   $     --recurse-submodules
   $cd TransceiverToolbox

To build the toolbox run the following:

.. shell::

   ~/TransceiverToolbox
   $make -C CI/scripts build

Add the application libraries for AD936X based devices if desired

.. shell::

   ~/TransceiverToolbox
   $make -C CI/scripts add_libad9361

To create a installable tlbx file run:

.. shell::

   ~/TransceiverToolbox
   $make -C CI/scripts gen_tlbx

Running Integrated HDL Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This process assumes the toolbox has been built. To run tests for a specific
carrier run the **test** target with the carrier name like so:

.. shell::

   ~/TransceiverToolbox
   $make -C CI/scripts test BOARD=zed

Without specifying the carrier all tests will run (This takes a long time!):

.. shell::

   ~/TransceiverToolbox
   $make -C CI/scripts test

Device Control and Data Streaming
---------------------------------

Device interfaces which provide control and data streaming are implemented with
MATLAB System Objects and Simulink Blocks. These System Objects can be access
under the "adi" namespace in MATLAB and are followed by their part number or
board name and finally Tx or Rx:

::

   adi.<Part or Board Name>.<Tx or Rx>

For example, to instantiate an AD9361 object to control the Tx aspects of the
transceiver it can be created as follows:

::

   tx = adi.AD9361.Tx;

All supported boards are derived from low level objects based on their parts.
For example, the DAQ2 Evaluation board actually contains an AD9680 and AD9144.
Therefore, it simply uses AD9680 and AD9144 objects under the hood. However, to
interact with the more familiar DAQ2 interface naming the Rx side can be
instantiated like above as:

::

   rx = adi.DAQ2.Rx;

For example usage of certain objects, it can be useful to inspect their related
test code which exercises initiations in different configurations. The available
code is available in the GitHub repo folder
`here <https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/MathWorks_tools/tree/master/test>`__,
where object tests have the naming convention ``<Object>Tests.m``.

To get a list of currently available objects with the BSP installed simply run:

::

   help adi

To get more information on a given object run:

::

   help adi.<Part of Board Name>.<Tx or Rx>

or

::

   doc adi.<Part of Board Name>.<Tx or Rx>

Common Attributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are some common attributes that need to be set for system objects and
parts.

-  ``uri`` Context address of IIO device. Possible options include:

   -  IP with usage ''rx.uri = 'ip:192.168.2.1' ''
   -  USB with usage ''rx.uri = 'usb:1.2.3' ''

Extending Interfaces
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a driver attribute or setting is not available in the standard objects it can
be easily extended to cover more IIO attributes.
See :ref:`matlab bsp-extend`.

HDL Targeting with HDL-Coder
----------------------------

**Targeting** is code generation that translates a designated MATLAB or
Simulink subsystem to HDL code and creates a custom bitstream for the FPGA
fabric. This custom bitstream is then downloaded to the FPGA on the development
board. By moving part or all of your algorithm to the hardware, you speed up
signal processing.

The Analog Devices Toolbox for MathWorks HDL Workflow Advisor is a collection of
board definitions and reference designs that provide to the MathWorks HDL
Workflow Advisor support to:

-  Generate IP blocks compatible with Analog Devices HDL reference designs for
   various Analog Devices platforms
-  Automatically insert the generated IPs into the Analog Devices Vivado HDL
   reference designs

This Analog Devices Toolbox is based on the
:mw:`MathWorks Board and Reference Design Registration System <help/hdlcoder/ug/board-and-reference-design-system.html>`.

Functionality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :mw:`MathWorks HDL Workflow Advisor <help/hdlcoder/examples/getting-started-with-hardware-software-codesign-workflow-for-xilinx-zynq-platform.html>`
enables users to automatically generate HDL code from a Simulink model. The user
can choose from a selection of several different Target Workflows, including
``ASIC/FPGA``, ``FPGA-In-The-Loop``, and ``IP Core Generation``. Target Platform
selections include Xilinx Evaluation Boards and Altera Evaluation Boards as well
as other custom evaluation boards.

The Analog Devices BSP for HDL Workflow Advisor extends the set of Target
Workflows for IP Core Generation with the Analog Devices boards listed in the
*Supported Platforms* section. The BSP consists of a set of board definitions
that specify all the characteristics needed by the HDL Workflow Advisor to be
able to incorporate a board in the code generation flow, as well as a set of
Xilinx Vivado reference designs that are used by the Workflow Advisor to
automatically insert the generated IPs into the Vivado designs. All the Analog
Devices Vivado HDL reference designs have inside a ‘donut hole’ to accommodate
custom IPs. Each design exposes a set of interface signals to which the IP can
connect to. All these signals are specified in the board definition and are
available in the Workflow Advisor GUI to connect to the generated IP’s ports.

When running the Workflow Advisor the first step if to select the Target
Platform. The figure below shows some of the available Analog Devices target
platforms.

|Analog Devices Target Platforms|

The next step is to configure the interfaces between the IP and the reference
design. Each target platform has a set of interface signals that are accessible
in the *Target Platform Interfaces* drop down boxes form step 1.2 (Set Target
Interface) of the HDL Workflow Advisor. The figure below shows an example of how
to configure the target interface for a specific model.

|Target Interface Signals|

All the Analog Devices AD9361 based SDR platforms have the same interface
signals and they are dependent on the type of flow that is selected – receive
(Rx) or transmit (Tx). The table below describes the interface signals for the
AD9361 based SDR platforms.

The custom IP always runs at the sample clock and must be able to process /
generate a sample every clock cycle.

Once the target interface has been defined, make sure to select the "Target
Language" as Verilog (defaults to VHDL) in Step 3.1.1 of the HDL Workflow
Advisor. All the other settings of steps 2 and 3 of the HDL Workflow Advisor can
be left in their default state and the project generation process can be started
by running step 4.1 (Create Project). The result of this step is a Vivado
project which has the custom IP core integrated into the Analog Devices HDL
reference design. The bistream for the design can be generated either by running
step 4.4 (Create bistream) or by compiling the generated Vivado Project directly
in Vivado. The project can be found in the *hdl_prj/vivado_ip_prj* folder.

Creating a BOOT.BIN from HDL Workflow Advisor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unlike the support package provided by MathWorks, the update process for the
bitstreams requires creation of a BOOT.BIN file which will be compatible with
the ADI SD card.

First make sure you have a valid SD card for your platform with the necessary
devicetree and kernel image selected.
:ref:`Follow this process here <kuiper sdcard>`.

Once your SD card is ready, in step 4.3 "Build FPGA Bitstream" of HDL Workflow
Advisor select a custom Tcl file for synthesis build. Utilize this
:git-TransceiverToolbox:`adi_build.tcl <CI/scripts/adi_build.tcl>`
file located within the BSP as your custom tcl file.

|image1|

Once the bitstream is built it will generate the BOOT.BIN necessary for booting
your system. Place the generated BOOT.BIN in the root of your ADI SD card's BOOT
partition.

Simulation Models of Hardware
-----------------------------

``Models`` are typically used primarily in simulation only types of environments
(they don't include any connection to hardware at all). Models can include many
different aspects of devices:

-  analog impairments (internal PLLs, mixers, LNA, gain stages, etc),
-  baseband impairments (ADC/DAC noise shaping, quantization, noise)
-  Digital Signal Processing impairments (the fixed and programmable DSP in the
   parts, quantization, overflow, latency, filtering, etc).

Some models may include all three aspects, some may only include one. It's very
common that as the model is of higher fidelity (includes more impairments, more
details to be modeled) it runs slower. The fidelity vs simulation speed is
always traded off by the model developer.

Some models are "complete" models, were developed and maintained by MathWorks,
outside of ADI's transceiver toolbox:
