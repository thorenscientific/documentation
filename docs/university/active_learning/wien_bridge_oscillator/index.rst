Background
----------

The Wien bridge oscillator holds a significant place in electronics history. Hewlett Packard's (HP) very first product, the Model 200A audio signal generator, was based on Bill Hewlett's 1939 Master's thesis at Stanford University. (see Linear Technology Application Note 43, Appendix C, “The Wien Bridge and Mr. Hewlett”) This groundbreaking device boasted impressive specifications for its time, including a 1-watt output and distortion better than 1% over most of the audio range, powered by standard line voltage. Beyond testing telephone amplifiers and general audio circuits, one of its earliest and most notable applications was in the production of Disney's Fantasia movie. You can even find a replica of Hewlett Packard's original garage at Stanford University, commemorating its role as the birthplace of Silicon Valley's "garage startup" culture. Bill Hewlett's original Master's thesis is available for perusal, offering a fascinating glimpse into the circuit theory and design from that era.

Oscillators are circuits that generate periodic waveforms without any input signal. They generally include some form of amplifier stage - transistors, OP-AMPs, vacuum tubes - with a feedback network consisting of a combination of passive devices such as resistors, capacitors, or inductors. This statement is intentionally general; there are lots of other ways to make an electronic oscillator. For example, the General Radio Type 213-B uses a tuning fork as the frequency selective component, and a carbon microphone as the amplification stage (See `The General Radio Experimenter, Volume IV, number II <https://www.rsp-italy.it/Electronics/Magazines/General%20Radio%20Experimenter/General%20Radio%20Experimenter%201930%2004.pdf>`_) Regardless of the implementation details, in order to oscillate, a linear circuit must satisfy the Barkhausen stability criterion [#]_ , which in simple terms states that at the frequency of oscillation:

* The loop gain is equal to unity in absolute magnitude
* The phase shift around the loop is zero or an integer multiple of 2π

Consider the first one, and its consequences in an oscillator: If the loop gain is less than unity, the oscillations will die out. If the loop gain is greater than unity, the oscillations will increase in amplitude, either forever (which is possible in a simulation), or until something limits the amplitude (hopefully gracefully, and not as the result of a catastrophic failure.) If the end application is not very sensitive to distortion (output frequencies at multiples of the desired fundamental frequency), then simple gain limiting methods can be employed - this could be as simple as allowing the amplifier output to “clip” at the supply voltage. But if the application requires a pure sine wave, then carefully controlling the amplifier's gain is absolutely critical.

There are various feedback elements employed to generate the required frequency-dependent phase shift - quartz crystals, mechanical resonators, L-C (inductor-capacitor) networks. The Wien_bridge was developed by Max Wien in 1891, as an extension of the Wheatstone_bridge. Whereas the Wheatstone bridge consists of purely resistive elements, the Wien bridge can be used to measure capacitors. While initially intended as a measurement circuit, at balance, the phase shift of a Wien bridge is zero, so including a gain element with a phase shift of zero will satisfy one of the Barkhausen criterion.

(It would have been impossible, or at least exceedingly difficult, to make an oscillator in 1891 as no linear electronic gain elements existed - the audion tube was invented in 1906.)

There are several advantages to using a Wien bridge as the feedback element in an oscillator:

* Simplicity
* Low distortion
* Ease of frequency adjustment, via either:
   * variable resistors
   * variable capacitors

With the phase shift satisfied, the other half of the Barkhausen criterion is a loop gain of unity. At resonance, the reactive arm of the Wien bridge has an attenuation of 1/3, so the amplifier must have a gain of 3. The circuit shown in :numref:`fig-wien_simple` is a simple Wien bridge oscillator with a 1.0kHz output that illustrates this principle.

   1.0kHz Wien Bridge Oscillator


Gain control is achieved with an incandescent light bulb (as it is in Bill Hewlett's configuration.) An incandescent bulb's resistance increases with power dissipation, and as a rough rule of thumb the hot resistance is often about 10 times the cold resistance. The #327 lamp shown has an operating voltage of 28V and operating current of 40mA, for a hot resistance of about 700 ohms, and a cold resistance of around 70 ohms, which matches actual measurements of a few bulbs. In order to achieve a non-inverting gain of 3, the lamp's resistance must be half of the feedback resistance, or about 215 ohms.

Once the circuit is oscillating, the amplitude control can be described as follows:

* If the gain is a little bit less than 3, the lamp cools down, its resistance drops, tending to increase the gain.
* If the gain is higher than 3, the lamp heats up, its resistance increases, tending to reduce the gain.

Eventually, the gain settles to a value that is likely very close to 3 - whatever is required to maintain oscillation - and the amplitude stabilizes.

Wheatstone Bridge Simulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to become familiar with the operation of a bridge circuit, open the
**wheatstone_bridge.asc** LTspice simulation shown in
:numref:`fig-wheatstone_ltspice`.

.. _fig-wheatstone_ltspice:

.. figure:: wheatstone_ltspice.png
   :align: center

   Wheatstone Bridge Simulation

Note that the bridge is initially unbalanced, and a small, but nonzero voltage appears at Vcd. (A Voltage-controlled voltage source with a gain of unity is a convenient way to measure the difference between two nodes such that it appears in the simulation results.) Experiment with different values for R3, noting that a value of 10k should balance the bridge and give a zero output. Try reducing R1 and R2 to 1k - does this have any effect on the output voltage?

AC Wien Bridge Simulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Open the **basic_wein_bridge.asc** LTspice simulation shown in :numref:`fig-basic_wien_ltspice`. The simulation is set up as an AC sweep from 100Hz to 10kHz, with the result shown in :numref:`fig-basic_wien_ltspice_result`. (Note that a DC bridge supply would produce a fairly predictable output - node C would be at ground potential, and node D would be at 1/3 of the supply.) Run the simulation and probe node C, the output of the reactive arm of the bridge. Notice the "Gentle" hump in response, peaking somewhere slightly less than 2kHz. Probe node Vcd next. Notice the extremely sharp null in response, making it very easy to locate the exact resonant frequency of 1.59kHz.

Simulated Wien Bridge Oscillator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Open the **wien_bridge_vcvs_gain.asc** LTspice simulation shown in :numref:`fig-wien_bridge_vcvs_gain`. This is a circuit that is impossible to build in real life—the gain stage is essentially perfect: infinite input impedance, zero output impedance, and no offset or gain error. But it allows us to experiment with ideal cases, to gain some intuition into the Barkhausen criterion and test out some assertions made in the background information.

.. _fig-wien_bridge_vcvs_gain:

   Wien Bridge Oscillator with Ideal Gain Stage

Ignoring V1 for the moment, note that when this simulation is started, all voltages are zero. There is no reason for it to do anything other than stay at zero forever. V1 is there to "kick" the circuit into operation by providing a step to the gain stage when the simulation is first started, then it ramps back to zero and has no further effect on the circuit's operation. Run the simulation, and probe the output node. Results should look similar to :numref:`fig-wien_bridge_vcvs_g_2p97`.

.. _fig-wien_bridge_vcvs_g_2p97:

.. figure:: wien_bridge_vcvs_g_2p97.png
   :align: center
   :width: 400

   Ideal Wien Oscillator, G=2.97

Note that the circuit oscillates for a few milliseconds, but the amplitude exponentially decays to zero. This is because the gain is set 1% too low (as you might expect if you built an amplifier with 1% resistors.) Next, set the value for E2 to 2.997, or about 0.1% too low, as shown in :numref:`fig-wien_bridge_vcvs_g_2p997`. Oscillations continue longer, but still decay.

.. _fig-wien_bridge_vcvs_g_2p997:

.. figure:: wien_bridge_vcvs_g_2p997.png
   :align: center
   :width: 400

   Ideal Wien Oscillator, G=2.997

Since we know that the gain needs to be exactly 3 to sustain oscillation, set the gain to 3.0 as shown in :numref:`fig-wien_bridge_vcvs_g_3p0` and run the simulation.

.. _fig-wien_bridge_vcvs_g_3p0:

.. figure:: wien_bridge_vcvs_g_3p0.png
   :align: center
   :width: 400

   Ideal Wien Oscillator, G=3.0

Notice that the operation is exactly as predicted, with a steady amplitude for the entire 250ms simulation time. This would never happen in real life, or even with simulations using a model of a real amplifier—the finite gain, finite input impedance, would cause the gain to be slightly more or less than 3.

As a final illustration that simulations can model situations that would be impossible in the real world, set the gain to 3.03 (1% too high) as shown in :numref:`fig-wien_bridge_vcvs_g_3p03` and run the simulation.

.. _fig-wien_bridge_vcvs_g_3p03:

.. figure:: wien_bridge_vcvs_g_3p03.png
   :align: center
   :width: 400

   Ideal Wien Oscillator, G=3.03

The output amplitude hits 15 **TERAVOLTS** after 250ms, with no end in sight. Again, this simulation is only to build intuition about the Barkhausen criterion and has no basis in reality. If you were to build this circuit with an op-amp configured with a gain of 3.03 and powered by +/-5V, oscillations would build until they approached 5V amplitude, then simply "clip" (producing a distorted waveform).

The circuit shown in :numref:`fig-wien_bridge_osc_complete_ltspice` is a complete (and practical) Wein bridge oscillator circuit that can be built on a breadboard and run as a simulation (**wien_bridge_osc_complete.asc**). Rather than using an incandescent bulb (which has a positive coefficient of resistance) for the amplifier's input resistor, this circuit shunts part of the feedback resistance with diodes, which have a negative coefficient of resistance. Ignoring the diodes, the gain would be 1+(10k+4.7k)/(4.7k+2k)), or about 3.19. But as the voltage across D1 and D2 approaches 600mV or so, the effective resistance of R2 is reduced, dropping the gain.

   Complete, Practical Wien Bridge Oscillator

Run the simulation; the output should resemble :numref:`fig-wien_bridge_osc_complete_result`. The "kick" circuit is not necessary to get the simulation to start... eventually. But the amplifier's offset in the model is quite low, so the kick helps the simulation start up much faster. Startup time is also a concern in some real-world applications, and circuits similar to V3, such as a pulse generator made from logic gates can be employed. Experiment with different values for vkick (including zero).

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#] Why Barkhausen "criterion" and not "criteria"?These two conditions are inseparable in practice:

   If the gain is right but the phase is off, the feedback won't reinforce the signal—it might even cancel it.
   If the phase is right but the gain is too low or too high, the oscillation won't sustain—it will either die out or grow uncontrollably.
   So, the Barkhausen criterion is not two independent criteria, but rather a compound condition—both parts must be satisfied at the same frequency for oscillation to occur. That’s why it’s referred to in the singular: “the Barkhausen criterion.”
